# Resnsselaer-trade-website
The project is to design an online secondary trading platform, which is mainly focused on the RPI community and requires all the users to login with their own  RCS ID. Furthermore, since the platform itself does not support online trading, it does not charge any potential fee from users and each buyer and seller can choose the transaction mode that they agree on.
